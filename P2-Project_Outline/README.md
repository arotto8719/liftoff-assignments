## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Include overview here:
A few months ago, our museum staff tried to do inventory of the collection.  There were some we had photos of but could 
not find information or location.  We found everything eventually but it was frustrating.
That's where I got the idea for the app.
It's a museum app where you can use an image in a database to find the object in the collection.
If the mouse hover over the image or you click the image, a window on the screen will automatically appear that will 
have the information about the object in the collection, including where it is in the collection.
It is still unknown if this will be an internal app for a musueum worker, an external database for anyone to use
online, such as a customer in the museum.  It could also be for a business.  For this app, I could use Boeing since they
have their history of their plane models already on a database on their site.

Here's a shorter version:

Boeing or Museum App: use Boeing archives site or a museum from the area and make the database from the site.
The User will be able to look through the database and use it whether it's a visitor or an employee.
-Museum had API and download and mess around with it
